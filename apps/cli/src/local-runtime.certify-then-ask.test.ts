/**
 * ZLens 0.1.0 second pre-publish e2e, N4. A block imported from SQL, saved as
 * a draft and then explicitly certified was never used by Ask: the import had
 * tagged the draft `review-required`, Certify only flipped its status, and
 * Ask's vocabulary silently skips a certified block that still says it needs
 * review. Naming the block then sent the question to AI-written SQL, which
 * refused because it did not filter on "Eligible" and "Players".
 *
 * Here the evidence block is certified through the product's Certify route
 * and asked about through the Ask host, by name and without naming it.
