 * ONE TRUST DECISION, ONE SET OF WORDS.

 * under them and the answer card. The server decides the trust once
 * (`trustState`) and says where the figures came from (the answer payload's
 * `route.tier`). Every label is read from those two here, so the heading can
 * never say "AI-generated answer" over a card that says it came from a
 * certified block, and a governed answer is never badged "AI-generated".
 *
 * The run's `route` is not a source: a certified block served as evidence and
 * an answer composed from declared relationships both resolve to the
 * `generated_answer` route without any SQL the AI wrote.
