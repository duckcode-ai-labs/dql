/**
 * Failure ORIGIN taxonomy.
 *
 * The Ask loop catches errors from four very different producers — the
 * warehouse driver, the DQL block compiler, DQL's own governance gates, and
 * retrieval — and used to funnel every one of them through
 * `normalizeWarehouseSqlFailure`, whose classifier is a set of regexes over the
 * message text. An internal throw such as `I need values for: region.` was
 * therefore reported to the user as
 *
 *   "The generated SQL failed to execute against the bounded preview: …"
 *
 * which is false: the warehouse was never contacted. The reverse also happened —
 * `createAnalyticalFailure` replaced a real driver message with a canned string,
 * so the true cause was unrecoverable even from the inspector.
 *
 * The rule this module enforces: **origin is assigned at the THROW site and is
 * never inferred at the catch site.** A catch site may only read the origin an
 * error already carries, and falls back to `warehouse` solely for errors that
 * genuinely came off a connector.
 *
 * The tag is a plain enumerable property rather than a Symbol on purpose: it
 * crosses a package boundary (`apps/cli` throws, `packages/dql-agent` catches)
 * and must survive two module instances resolving to different copies.
