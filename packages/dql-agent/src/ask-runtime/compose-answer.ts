/**
 * THE writer of terminal sentences.
 *
 * Nine places used to write the sentence a reader sees when a question does
 * not end in a result — the engine's refusal-code table, its incident switch,
 * its last-resort answer, the lane's no-answer branches, the floor's refusal,
 * the CLI's headline — and they drifted: one said "snapshot", one said
 * "dispatch", one said "orchestration budget". Every producer now describes
 * its outcome as a typed SHAPE and this module turns the shape into words.
 * The internal reason codes stay for traces; the number of user sentences is
 * bounded by the shapes below, not by how many code paths exist.
 *
 * House rule for every sentence: say what happened to the QUESTION, name what
 * IS available when we know it, never name the machinery.
