```bash
zlens --help
zlens --version
```

## Running the CLI

The command prefix depends on how ZLens was installed:

| Installation | Command form | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project-local (recommended) | `npm exec -- zlens <command>` | Any CLI command using the version in this repository |
| Project-local starter script | `npm run doctor`, `npm run notebook`, and similar | Common commands already declared in `package.json` |
| Project-local shorthand | `npx zlens <command>` | Convenient when the local dependency is already installed |
| Global | `zlens <command>` | A global installation available everywhere on `PATH` |

For example:

```bash
npm install
npm run doctor
npm exec -- zlens model list
npm exec -- zlens --help
```

`npm run` adds `node_modules/.bin` to `PATH` for that script. A normal shell
does not, so a bare `zlens` command requires
`npm install -g @zlens/cli`. The command tables below use the
short global form for readability; prepend `npm exec --` for a project-local
installation.

## Commands

### Project

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `zlens init [dir]` | Initialize ZLens in a project (auto-detects dbt) |
| `zlens init [dir] --warehouse-first` | Initialize a project that models the database's own tables, no dbt needed (`manifestVersion: 3`, `modeling.mode: "warehouse-first"`) |
| `zlens doctor [path]` | Run local setup checks |
| `zlens doctor scale` | Report enterprise-scale manifest/cache/index health |
| `zlens doctor git-hygiene` | Flag tracked local/generated files before commit |
| `zlens validate [path]` | Validate all `.dql` files and semantic references |
| `zlens compile [path]` | Generate project manifest (`dql-manifest.json`) |
| `zlens verify [path]` | Verify that `dql-manifest.json` is reproducible from tracked source |

`zlens doctor scale --format json` includes counts, cache freshness,
metadata/KG index state, context-pack timing, source fingerprints, domain
shards, and top rejected evidence candidates that were relevant but excluded by
retrieval caps.

`zlens doctor git-hygiene --format json` checks tracked files against the OSS Git
policy and flags `.dql/cache`, `.dql/local`, `*.run.json`, `dql-manifest.json`,
local databases, data files, AI pins, saved views, and layout overrides.
