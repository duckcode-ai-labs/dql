# ZLens

**Governed analytics on your warehouse — with or without dbt.**

ZLens is an open-source analytics workbench. It works on top of your dbt
project, or straight on your database's own tables. You build
**blocks** (reviewed, reusable queries), turn them into **Apps**, and **Ask**
questions in plain English. Every answer and every tile says how far to trust
it: **Certified**, **Governed**, **Needs review**, or a refusal with the
reason.

Everything is a file in your project, so it is reviewed in git like code. ZLens runs on your machine; no hosted account is needed.

## Start here

1. [Quickstart](get-started/index.md): run ZLens on a sample dbt project and
   get your first result in about ten minutes. No dbt?
   [Start from your database](get-started/no-dbt.md).
2. [Ask a question](ask/index.md) and read its trust label.
3. [Certify a block](blocks/certify.md) so Ask and Apps can trust it.

## Follow the journey

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Get started](get-started/index.md)** | Install, open the workbench, connect a database and an AI provider, add ZLens to your dbt project or start from your database alone. |
| **[Ask and trust](ask/index.md)** | Certified answers, answers that need review and their saved drafts, refusals with a reason, and how each answer was made. |
| **[Build blocks](blocks/index.md)** | Import SQL, work in Block Studio, save drafts and certify them. |
| **[Notebooks](notebooks/index.md)** | SQL and DQL cells, results, saving a cell as a block, and sharing through git. |
| **[Apps and dashboards](apps/index.md)** | Read an App and its trust labels, build and publish one, ask questions about it. |
| **[Lineage](lineage/index.md)** | From dbt models to blocks to Apps, in the workbench and the terminal. |
| **[Connect your AI agent](agents/index.md)** | Use ZLens from Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or Claude Desktop over MCP. |
| **[Reference](reference/cli.md)** | CLI, DQL language, file formats, project layout, connectors. |

## How trust works

- **Saving never certifies.** Anything saved, imported or kept from an AI
  answer is a draft until a person clicks **Certify**.
- **Ask tries the most trusted source first**: a certified block, then the
  semantic layer, then SQL written by AI, which is marked for review and saved
  as a draft.
- **When ZLens cannot answer safely, it says so**, and why, instead of
  guessing.
