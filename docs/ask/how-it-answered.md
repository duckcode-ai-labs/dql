# How Ask answered

Every Ask run is recorded on your machine. You can see, for any answer, which
sources Ask looked at, what it skipped, the SQL that ran and the checks it
passed.

## From an answer

1. Under the answer, click **How it was answered**.
2. The panel opens on **How it answered**. It starts with the outcome, such as
   **Answered from a certified block.**, and a line like
   `Worked for 52 s · 6 steps · 1 AI call`.
3. Read the steps in order:
    - **Read the question**: how Ask understood it.
    - **Certified blocks**: whether a certified block answers it.
    - **Semantic layer**: whether metrics and dimensions could answer it.
    - **Governed tables** and **AI wrote SQL**: used only when nothing more
      trusted could answer.
    - **Checked before running** and **Ran on the warehouse**.
    - **Answer**, or **No answer** with the reason.

    Each step is marked done or skipped. Click a step to see its details, such
    as the AI calls and the SQL it wrote.
4. Use the other tabs for the detail: **DQL**, **SQL**, **Data used** (the
   certified block, metrics, dimensions, tables, joins and filters) and
   **Checks**.
5. Click **Open full trace** for the complete record.

## Ask observability

In the left rail, under **Govern**, click **Ask observability**. It lists
every local Ask run, newest first.

Filter the list by:

- **Outcome**: completed, blocked, failed, cancelled and more.
- **Mode**: Ask or Research.
- **Selected tier**: **Certified**, **Semantic**, **Governed relational**,
  **Exploratory SQL**, **Clarify or gap**.
- **Trust**: **Certified**, **Governed**, **Review required**, **Blocked**.

Click **Open trace** on a run. The trace page has three views: **Trace Tree**
(the steps, nested), **Agent Graph** (how the steps depend on each other) and
**Timeline** (where the time went).

The trace keeps what each AI call was for, how long it took and its reply,
the checks, the SQL that ran and a sample of its rows. It does not keep full
prompts, credentials or file paths.

## From the terminal

```bash
zlens agent trace list
zlens agent trace show <trace-id>
```

To share a run with a maintainer without sharing your data, export a
**strict** bundle. It replaces identifiers with stand-ins and refuses raw
SQL, URLs, paths and secrets:

```bash
zlens agent trace export <trace-id> --out ./ask-trace-strict --profile strict
zlens agent trace validate ./ask-trace-strict
```

Compare two runs, for example before and after a fix:

```bash
zlens agent trace compare ./before ./after --mode compare
```
