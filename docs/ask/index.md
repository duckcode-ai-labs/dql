# Ask a question

**Ask** answers business questions in plain English. Every answer says what
it is built on, so you know how far to trust it.

ZLens tries the most trusted source first:

1. a **certified block** that answers the question,
2. then **semantic metrics** from your semantic layer,
3. then **SQL written by AI** from your tables, marked as needing review.

If none of these can answer safely, Ask refuses and says why.

!!! note "Before you start"
    Ask needs an AI provider, even for certified answers. See
    [Set up an AI provider](../get-started/ai-provider.md).

## Ask

1. In the left rail, click **Ask**.
2. Type your question in **Ask anything about your data…**, for example
   `Who are the top customers by lifetime spend?`
3. Press **Enter**. (**Shift+Enter** adds a new line.)

While Ask works, you see each step, such as `Searched the project: 1
certified block, 24 metrics…` and `Asking the AI to read the question`.
Click **Stop** to cancel.

## Read the answer

The answer starts with a trust line, then a short summary and the result
table. For a question that a certified block answers:

- The trust line reads **Certified answer**, followed by **from** and the
  block's name, and the block's **Owner**.
- The result card says `certified block`.
- **Results** shows the rows; **Visualization** shows a chart.

Other trust lines:

| Trust line | Means |
|---|---|
| **Certified answer** | Ran a certified block exactly as reviewed. |
| **Governed answer** | Built from semantic metrics and dimensions. |
| **AI-generated answer** | AI wrote the SQL from your tables. Check it before relying on it. ZLens saves it as a draft block for review; see [Answers that need review](needs-review.md). |
| **Needs clarification** | Ask needs one more detail. Answer the question it asks. |
| **Couldn't run this query** or **No matching data** | Ask refused or found nothing, and says why. See [When Ask refuses](refusals.md). |

## See how it answered

Under each answer, click **How it was answered**. A panel opens with tabs:

- **How it answered**: the steps it took, such as **Certified blocks**,
  **Semantic layer**, **Checked before running** and **Ran on the warehouse**,
  each marked done or skipped.
- **DQL** and **SQL**: exactly what ran.
- **Data used**: the certified block, metrics, tables, joins and filters.
- **Checks**: the checks run before the query.

See [How Ask answered](how-it-answered.md) for the full trace.

## Keep the answer

In the answer's panel:

- **Save as block** saves the query as a draft block. See
  [Save and certify](../blocks/certify.md).
- **Add to app** adds the result to an App.

## Narrow the question to one domain

Click **Scope: All domains** above the question box. Pick a **Domain**, and
optionally a **Subject area** and a **Purpose**, then click **Apply**. Ask then
searches only that domain's models, terms and skills.

## Choose how hard Ask thinks

Click **Answer settings** (the sliders icon under the question box):

- **Thinking**: **Auto** (default), **Low**, **Medium** or **High**. **High**
  cross-checks the number, so it is slower.
- **Research mode**: for "why" questions that need several queries.
- **Model**: shows the AI provider in use. Change it in
  **Settings → AI provider**.

## Conversations

- Each conversation is kept, so you can continue it later. They are listed
  under **Recent**; pin the ones you use often to **Favourites**.
- **New chat** starts a fresh conversation.
- Conversations are private to your machine and are not committed to git.

## Ask from the terminal

```bash
zlens agent ask "Who are the top customers by lifetime spend?"
```

It prints the trust label (`✓ Certified`, `! AI-generated · review required`
or `✕ Blocked`), the answer, and the thread id. Continue the conversation
with `--thread <id>`. List conversations with `zlens agent threads`.

Your AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) can use the same Ask through MCP.
