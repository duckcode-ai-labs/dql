# Blocks

A **block** is a named, reusable query saved as a `.dql` file. It carries the
SQL (or a semantic metric query) plus an owner, a domain, a description,
tests and a chart. Ask answers from certified blocks first, and App tiles are
built from blocks.

## Where blocks come from

| Start from | How |
|---|---|
| Existing SQL files or pasted SQL | [Import SQL](import-sql.md) |
| A notebook cell | **Save Block** on the cell. See [Notebooks](../notebooks/index.md#save-a-cell-as-a-block). |
| An Ask answer you want to keep | **Save as block** on the answer, or the review draft Ask saves for you. See [Answers that need review](../ask/needs-review.md). |
| Nothing yet | **New block** in [Block Studio](block-studio.md) |
| A terminal | `zlens new block "<name>"` or `zlens import sql <path>` |

Whichever way you start, the result is a **draft**. A person certifies it
later. See [Save and certify](certify.md).

## Find your blocks

1. In the left rail, click **Blocks**.
2. The sidebar lists blocks in folders by domain. Draft blocks that Ask or
   Import SQL saved for review are in a **Drafts** folder.
3. Narrow the list with **Search blocks…** or the domain menu (**All domains**).

The line under the search box counts them, for example `3 blocks · 1 draft ·
all domains`.

Each row shows the block's name, domain and status. A **Private** badge means
the block is saved only on your machine, outside git, until you publish it.

## Block status

Block Studio shows a block's status as a badge:

| Badge | Means |
|---|---|
| **Draft** | Saved, not reviewed. Ask does not use it as a trusted answer. |
| **Certified** | A person certified it. Ask and Apps treat it as trusted. |
| **In review** | Marked for review. |
| **Recertify** | Something it depends on changed; certify it again. |
| **Deprecated** | Retired. If it names a replacement, Block Studio shows **Replaced by** and links to it. |

## What a block file looks like

```dql
// dql-format: 1

block "Top customers by lifetime spend" {
  status = "certified"
  domain = "uncategorized"
  type = "custom"
  description = "The ten customers with the highest lifetime spend, with their order counts."
  owner = "analytics@example.com"
  query = """
    select customer_name, count_lifetime_orders, lifetime_spend
    from dev.customers
    order by lifetime_spend desc
    limit 10
  """
  visualization {
    chart = "table"
  }
}
```

- Blocks are saved under `blocks/<domain>/`, or `domains/<domain>/blocks/` when
  your project uses domain folders.
- Drafts that Ask or Import SQL created go in a `_drafts/` folder until they
  are certified.
- Each block has a companion file under `semantic-layer/blocks/` that records
  its review status and, once certified, who certified it.

The full syntax is in the [DQL language reference](../reference/language.md).
