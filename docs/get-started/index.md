# Quickstart

Run ZLens on a small sample dbt project and get your first result. It takes
about ten minutes.

You end with:

- the ZLens workbench open at `http://127.0.0.1:3474`
- the sample DuckDB database connected
- a notebook with your first query result

{{ clip("quickstart") }}

## Before you start

You need:

- Node.js 20 or newer (`node -v`)
- Python 3.9 to 3.13, to build the sample with dbt (`python3 --version`)
- git

No warehouse account, hosted service or sign-in is needed.

## 1. Get the sample dbt project

The sample is the Jaffle Shop dbt project on DuckDB. Clone it and build its
database:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duckcode-ai/jaffle-shop-duckdb.git
cd jaffle-shop-duckdb
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/dbt deps --profiles-dir .
.venv/bin/dbt seed --profiles-dir .
.venv/bin/dbt build --profiles-dir . --exclude resource_type:seed
```

You now have `jaffle_shop.duckdb` and `target/manifest.json` in the folder.

!!! note
    The sample also has `./setup.sh`, which runs steps 1 to 3 in one go once
    you have cloned it. Then continue at [step 4](#4-open-the-workbench).

## 2. Add ZLens

The sample is already a ZLens workspace: its `dql.config.json` is in the
`jaffle-shop-duckdb` folder, next to `dbt_project.yml`. From that folder:

```bash
npm install
npm install --prefix .dql/connectors duckdb
```

- `npm install` installs the ZLens CLI (`@zlens/cli`) into this folder. No
  global install is needed.
- The second command installs the DuckDB driver. Other databases need their
  own driver; see [Connect a database](connect-database.md).

!!! warning "Do not run `create-zlens-app` in the sample"
    `npx create-zlens-app` inside the sample creates a second, empty workspace
    in `dql/`, without the sample's domain, blocks, App and notebook. If you
    already have a `dql/` folder from an older quickstart, delete it.

## 3. Import the dbt project

```bash
npm run sync
```

ZLens reads the dbt manifest and builds its index. The last line is:

```text
✓ dbt sync complete — manifest, metadata, and agent index share the refreshed project state (… indexed object(s)).
```

## 4. Open the workbench

```bash
npm run notebook
```

The terminal prints `Notebook ready: http://127.0.0.1:3474` and your browser
opens it. Leave the terminal running.

## 5. Finish the guided setup

The first time, ZLens opens **Guided Setup** in four steps.

1. **Where does your data model live?** The sample is already a ZLens
   project on a dbt project, so **dbt project** is selected, and below it,
   under **Connect your dbt project**, you see **dbt project ready** with
   the path field showing `.` (this folder). Click **Preview**. ZLens shows
   the models, sources and metrics it found and says **Nothing has changed
   yet**. Click **Apply project**, then **Continue to database**. (No dbt
   project of your own? See [No dbt? Start from your database](no-dbt.md).)
2. **Connect your database.** The sample's DuckDB connection is already set
   up: you see **DuckDB · configured** and **Test passed**. Click
   **Continue to optional AI**.
3. **Set up an AI provider.** This step is optional. Ask needs a model, but
   notebooks, blocks, Apps and lineage do not. Set one up now
   ([how](ai-provider.md)) or click **Continue to finish**.
4. **Where do you want to start?** Click **Finish setup**.

You can run the setup again later from **Settings → Overview → Guided Setup**.

## 6. Run your first query

1. In the left rail, click **Notebooks**.
2. Click **New Notebook**, type a name such as `Customer orders`, and click
   **Create notebook**.
3. Click **Create DQL query**, then **Switch to SQL cell**.
4. Type this query:

    ```sql
    select customer_name, count_lifetime_orders, lifetime_spend
    from dev.customers
    order by lifetime_spend desc
    limit 10
    ```

5. Press **Shift+Enter**.

The cell shows **Success** and a table of ten customers. The notebook saves
itself as `notebooks/customer_orders.dqlnb`.

## Your own dbt project

The sample ships with its ZLens workspace. For your own dbt project, create
one with `npx create-zlens-app@latest dql` from the dbt repo; see
[Add ZLens to your dbt project](your-dbt-project.md).

## No dbt?

ZLens also works straight on your database: connect it, choose the schemas
to model, and ZLens drafts the entities and joins for you to certify. See
[No dbt? Start from your database](no-dbt.md).

## Next

- [Find your way around](workbench.md) the workbench.
- [Ask a question](../ask/index.md) in plain English.
- [Save the query as a block](../blocks/index.md) and certify it.
- [Add ZLens to your own dbt project](your-dbt-project.md), or
  [start from your database](no-dbt.md) without dbt.
