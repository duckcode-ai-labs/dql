# Concepts

ZLens is a layer for certified analytics on your warehouse. If you use dbt,
dbt builds and tests your models and ZLens reads them; if you don't, ZLens
models your database's own tables (see [No dbt?](no-dbt.md)). ZLens covers what people
do with the data next: the queries, dashboards and AI answers. Everything is a file in your project, so it can be reviewed
in git.

## Block

A **block** is a named, reusable query saved as a `.dql` file. Besides the
SQL (or a semantic metric query), it records an owner, a domain, a
description, tests and a chart. Blocks are what ZLens reuses, reviews and
cites.

```dql
block "Revenue by Segment" {
  domain = "finance"
  type = "custom"
  status = "draft"
  owner = "analytics@company.com"
  description = "Total order revenue by customer segment"

  query = """
SELECT segment, SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM analytics.orders
GROUP BY 1
"""

  tests {
    assert row_count > 0
  }
}
```

## Draft and certified

Every block has a status. The two that matter most:

- **Draft**: saved, but nobody has vouched for it yet.
- **Certified**: a person checked it. Certifying runs the block and its tests
  and records who certified it and when.

**Saving never certifies.** Saving a block, importing SQL, or keeping an AI
answer always makes a draft. Only a person clicking **Certify** (or running
`zlens certify --from-draft`) makes a block certified.

See [Save and certify](../blocks/certify.md).

## Trust labels

Every answer and every App tile says how far to trust it:

| Label | Means |
|---|---|
| **Certified** | It ran a certified block exactly as reviewed. |
| **Governed** | It was built from semantic metrics and dimensions. |
| **Needs review** / **AI-generated** | AI wrote the SQL. Check it before relying on it. |
| A refusal | ZLens could not answer safely and says why, instead of guessing. |

See [Ask and trust](../ask/index.md).

## Notebook

A **notebook** (`.dqlnb`) is a list of cells: SQL, DQL, notes and inputs. It
is where you explore. Results are kept in a git-ignored `.run.json` file next
to it, so they never end up in a commit. A useful cell becomes a block with
**Save Block**. See [Notebooks](../notebooks/index.md).

## Semantic layer

The shared business vocabulary: **metrics** (such as revenue) and
**dimensions** (such as customer segment). ZLens imports dbt's semantic
models, so a DQL cell can ask for `@metric(revenue)` by `@dim(segment)`
without writing joins. See [Semantic layer](../reference/semantic-layer.md).

## App

An **App** is a set of dashboard and report pages for a decision or a team,
built from blocks. Each tile shows its trust label, and readers can ask
questions about the App. Published Apps live in `apps/<app-id>/`. See
[Apps](../apps/index.md).

## Manifest

`dql-manifest.json` is ZLens's compiled view of the project: blocks,
notebooks, Apps, metrics, the dbt models they read, and the links between
them. `zlens compile` and `zlens sync dbt` write it.

## Lineage

**Lineage** is the graph from source tables and dbt models through blocks to
the Apps that show them. It answers "where did this number come from?" and
"what uses this model?". See [Lineage](../lineage/index.md).

## How they fit

```text

                                             lineage
```

## What the open-source version is

ZLens open source is a local, single-user workspace. Certification,
personas and App visibility are local labels kept in your files; they are
not a hosted permission system.
