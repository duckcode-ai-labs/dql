# Troubleshooting + FAQ

Real fixes for the things that bite people first.

## Setup

### `zlens` says "command not found"

**In a scaffolded project** the CLI is a local dev dependency, exposed through
npm scripts (`npm run notebook`, `npm run compile`, …). For ad-hoc commands
use `npx`:

```bash
npx zlens --version
npx zlens certify blocks/revenue_by_month.dql
```

If `npx zlens` still fails, re-run `npm install` — the dependency link
probably broke.

**With a global install** (`npm i -g @zlens/cli`), a bare `zlens`
that reports "command not found" almost always means one of three things:

```bash
npx -p @zlens/cli@latest zlens --version   # escape hatch: no PATH needed at all
which -a zlens          # a stale Homebrew / venv / old global copy shadowing it?
hash -r                 # clear the shell's cached path, or just open a new terminal
npm prefix -g           # ensure "<that path>/bin" is on your $PATH
npm i -g @zlens/cli@latest   # a failed earlier install never links the bin
```

The last one is the usual culprit for existing users: before **1.6.30**, a
global install could **fail on Node 23/24** (the current LTS is Node 24). A
failed `npm i -g` never creates the `zlens` symlink, so the command is missing
even though "install" appeared to run. Reinstalling `@latest` on any Node ≥20
fixes it — see [How do I upgrade ZLens?](#how-do-i-upgrade-zlens) below.

### How do I upgrade ZLens?

ZLens is plain npm packages — upgrading is just installing the latest version.

```bash
# Global CLI
npm i -g @zlens/cli@latest && zlens --version

# Project-local CLI (recommended)
npm i -D @zlens/cli@latest && npx zlens --version
```

You do **not** need a working `zlens` to upgrade, and you do **not** need to
downgrade Node — 1.6.30+ installs on Node 20, 22, and 24. If `zlens --version`
still shows the old number afterward, run `hash -r` (or open a new shell) and
check `which -a zlens` for a shadowing copy.

### `zlens --version` works, but `cd dql` says "no such file or directory"

The CLI install only installs the command. It does not create a project folder.
From your dbt repo root, initialize ZLens first:

```bash
zlens init ./dql
cd dql
zlens doctor
```

Use `zlens init .` only if you want ZLens folders directly in the current repo
root.

### Optional connector package errors

DuckDB and Snowflake drivers are installed project-locally when needed. If the
**Settings → Database** says a driver package is missing, click **Install connector** or
run the printed project-local install command. If a native package fails to
build on a fresh OS install, check Node `20`, `22`, or `24` LTS and local build tools.

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Then retry the connector install. For local project dependencies, wiping and
reinstalling can help:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

(Building the framework repo from source? Use `pnpm install && pnpm -r build`.)

### Preview doesn't open

`zlens preview` opens your default browser. If you're on a headless box or
the open command silently fails:

```bash
zlens preview blocks/revenue_by_month.dql --no-open
```

It still serves on localhost; the URL is printed in the console output.

---

## Authoring blocks

### `zlens certify` says `tests-pass: ✗` but the data looks right

The certifier runs the block against `defaultConnection` from
`dql.config.json` (or the connection you pass with `--connection`). If
your local DuckDB doesn't have the tables but your prod warehouse does,
you'll see different test results. Pin the connection explicitly:

```bash
zlens certify blocks/foo.dql --connection duckdb
```

— and make sure the connection actually contains the tables the block
reads (for a dbt project, run `dbt build` first).

### `Block parse error in blocks/foo.dql`

The most common cause is `query = "..."` (single-line) where the SQL
contains characters that need escaping. Use triple-quoted strings:

```dql
query = """
  SELECT 1
"""
```

### Block doesn't show up in the manifest

`zlens compile` only scans `blocks/`, `dashboards/`, `workbooks/`, and
`apps/<id>/blocks/` (when configured). If your block lives somewhere
else, add the directory to `dql.config.json`:

```json
{
  "extraBlockDirs": ["custom_blocks"]
}
```

### Two blocks have the same name

The manifest keys by `block.name` (the string after `block "..."`). If
two `.dql` files both declare `block "foo"`, the second one silently
overwrites the first — but `zlens validate` catches it as an error. Run
`zlens validate` early.

---

## Apps + Local Policies

### `zlens app build` says "homepage references unknown dashboard"

Either:

1. The dashboard id in `dql.app.json`'s `homepage` doesn't match any
   `.dqld` file's `id` field, or
2. You renamed a `.dqld` file but kept the homepage id pointing at the
   old name.

Open `apps/<id>/dashboards/*.dqld` and confirm the `id` field matches.

### Persona switcher does nothing

Two common causes:

1. **You're not in the App view.** The persona switcher only renders when
   `mainView === 'apps'`. Click the **Apps** activity bar icon first.
2. **The App has no members.** Open `dql.app.json` — the `members[]`
   array must be non-empty.

Verify on the server:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3475/api/persona | jq
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3475/api/apps    | jq
```

### Branch viewer sees rows from other branches

`@rls` only narrows when the **block** carries the decorator. Confirm:

1. The block declares `@rls("branch", "{user.branch}")` (and `@rls("region", …)`).
2. The App has `rlsBindings` mapping `role: "branch_viewer"` → `from: "branch"`.
3. The member's `attributes.branch` is set.

Trace the resolution:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3475/api/persona | jq '.persona.rlsContext'
```

`rlsContext` should show the substituted values. If it's `{}`, the App
binding didn't match the member's roles + attributes.

### `policies[].domain = "*"` doesn't match my block's domain

Wildcard `*` matches every domain. If you want "any domain in the cards
org", make policies explicit per domain (`cards`, `cards.fraud`,
`cards.chargebacks`) — the engine doesn't currently parse hierarchical
domains.

---

## Agent

### `zlens agent ask` says "KG not built"

Run the reindex:

```bash
zlens agent reindex
```

That's the build step for `.dql/cache/agent-kg.sqlite`. It's also a no-op
fast on rebuilds because the manifest fingerprint is checked first.

### Provider returns nothing

Check `available()` per-provider:

```bash
node -e "
  const a = require('@zlens/agent');
  for (const name of ['claude','openai','gemini','ollama']) {
    a.buildProvider(name).available().then(ok => console.log(name, ok));
  }
"
```

> If only `ollama` shows `true`, you have no API keys set. That's fine —
> the agent will use Ollama. If `ollama` returns `false`, the daemon
> isn't running. Start it: `ollama serve`.

### Every certified block answer cites the same block, even when wrong

The FTS5 retrieval threshold is too loose for your domain. Tune in
[`packages/dql-agent/src/answer-loop.ts`](https://github.com/duckcode-ai-labs/zlens/blob/main/packages/dql-agent/src/answer-loop.ts):

```ts
const CERTIFIED_HIT_THRESHOLD = 0.18;   // raise to 0.30 for stricter matching
const HARD_NEGATIVE_RATIO     = 0.5;    // lower to 0.3 to disqualify on fewer downvotes
```

Rebuild and reindex.

### Ask found the right metric but says the governed query failed

Open **How it was answered** on the failed answer. The inspector keeps the exact
plan and, when compilation reached them, the DQL and SQL that were attempted.
Its final section shows a stable failure code and only the repairs allowed for
that failure.

- `RELATION_NOT_FOUND` or `COLUMN_NOT_FOUND`: make the active connection point
  at the warehouse containing the dbt-built relations, run `dbt build` when
  appropriate, then use **Refresh snapshot and prepare retry**. Do not replace
  the governed relation with a similarly named table.
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: change to an explicitly authorized connection or request
  access. ZLens will not retry another source automatically.
- `DIALECT_ERROR` or `AMBIGUOUS_COLUMN`: open the retained DQL/SQL in Notebook,
  edit the derived copy, and rerun through the normal guards. The source run and
  its receipt remain unchanged.
- `TIMEOUT`: retry the same bounded plan. Research is not started implicitly.
- `RESULT_CONTRACT_MISMATCH`: the query did not return every field promised by
  the plan, so the result cannot be narrated or saved as a complete answer.

For “today” and other relative periods, `latest_complete` also needs a governed
reporting-time dimension and an authorized freshness observation. ZLens performs
one bounded lookup using the already selected semantic metric/time members. A
missing table or permission during that lookup is reported with the same stable
warehouse failure code.

### Ask cannot connect a metric to a customer or time dimension

Check the semantic model rather than adding a broad repository search. The
metric capability must declare its primary entity, additivity, supported
customer/time dimensions and roles, relationship path, time grains, freshness
policy, operations, outputs, and adapter. Domain Skills may choose defaults such
as timezone, completeness, comparison alignment, or ranking period, but they
cannot invent a member, authorize a join, or override an incompatible metric.

Repository text search remains discovery evidence for dbt models and columns
when governed coverage is absent. It can help build a review-required SQL plan;
it never upgrades a grep match into semantic relationship proof.

### Slack bot returns 401 "Bad signature"

In order of likelihood:

1. **Body modification.** Slack signs the raw body. Some reverse proxies
   strip whitespace or rewrite content-type. Bypass them or move the bot
   directly behind ngrok.
2. **Wrong signing secret.** Compare with the **Basic Information** page
   of your Slack app — not the Bot User OAuth Token (which is different).
3. **Stale request.** The verifier rejects requests > 5 minutes old.
   Clock skew is rare but check `date` on your server.

### Slack bot reply never arrives

The bot acks immediately ("Working on it…") then posts the real reply
via `response_url`. If the response URL POST fails (firewall, DNS,
timeouts), Slack will not retry. Check the bot logs for the failed
fetch — `zlens slack serve` doesn't yet have structured logging; pipe to
a file or wrap with `2>&1 | tee dql-slack.log`.

## CI / `zlens verify`

### `zlens verify` says "drift" but the diff looks empty

The diff prints terse change descriptions. To see the full per-block
diff, use `--format json`:

```bash
zlens verify --format json | jq
```

Common silent drift causes:

- A block test result changed (a stat was non-deterministic).
- A semantic-layer YAML moved.
- `dbtImport` filters changed.

If you can't pin it, force a fresh compile and inspect:

```bash
mv dql-manifest.json /tmp/old-manifest.json
zlens compile
diff /tmp/old-manifest.json dql-manifest.json | head -80
```

### `zlens certify` is non-deterministic in CI

If a block test like `assert row_count >= 100` flickers, the underlying data
is non-deterministic. Either:

1. Pin the test data (commit a small CSV that drives the test).
2. Loosen the assertion (a lower bound rather than an exact `==`).
3. Move volatile expectations to `invariants` (which are documentation for the
   agent, not executable). Note `assert` compares a single returned column to a
   value (`assert <column> <op> <value>`) — wrap any aggregation in the block's
   SQL and assert on the resulting column.
